##Ben's UDP Chat
This is a simple, peer-to-peer chat program for LAN networks, using
UDP broadcast packets.

I have now integrated MDES encryption to protect the UDP Packets.
Furthermore, there are now better aesthetics, performance and stability traits.

This will be updated over time, to allow the sending of files, etc.

To run, simply extract everything to a folder, 
then double click Ben's Chat.pyw.

Enjoy :)
