# Ben's UDP Chat
This is a simple, peer-to-peer chat program for LAN networks, using
UDP broadcast packets. A small project I made back in high school.

Uses a made up "encryption" algorithm to obfuscate transmitted data and
saved chat logs.

# Original readme.txt from 2015

I have now integrated MDES encryption to protect the UDP Packets.
Furthermore, there are now better aesthetics, performance and stability traits.

This will be updated over time, to allow the sending of files, etc.

To run, simply extract everything to a folder, 
then double click Ben's Chat.pyw.

Enjoy :)
